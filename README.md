# COVID-19-SEIR
This study uses transformed subsystem of ordinary differential equation seirs model, 
with vital dynamics of birth and death rates, and temporary immunity (of infectious 
individuals or vaccinated susceptible) to evaluate the disease-free DFEX¯DFE, and 
endemic EEX¯EE equilibrium points, using the Jacobian matrix eigenvalues λi of both 
disease-free equilibrium X¯DFE, and endemic equilibrium X¯EE for COVID-19 infectious 
disease to show S, E, I, and R ratios to the population in time-series. In order to 
obtain the disease-free equilibrium point, globally asymptotically stable ( R0≤1 ), 
the effect of control strategies has been added to the model (in order to decrease 
transmission rate β, and reinforce susceptible to recovered flow), to determine how 
much they are effective, in a mass immunization program. The effect of transmission 
rates β (from S to E ) and α (from R to S ) varies, and when vaccination effect ρ, is 
added to the model, disease-free equilibrium X¯DFE is globally asymptotically stable, 
and the endemic equilibrium point X¯EE, is locally unstable. The initial conditions 
for the decrease in transmission rates of β and α, reached the corresponding disease-free 
equilibrium X¯DFE locally unstable, and globally asymptotically stable for endemic 
equilibrium X¯EE. The initial conditions for the decrease in transmission rate sβ and α, 
and increase in ρ, reached the corresponding disease-free equilibrium X¯DFE globally 
asymptotically stable, and locally unstable in endemic equilibrium X¯EE.
